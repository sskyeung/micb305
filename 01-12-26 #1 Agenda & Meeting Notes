** 1/12/26 Meeting Notes **
  -- Agenda/Meeting note Requirements:
    }} Agenda has to be submitted night before (on GitHub)
    }} Need to assign a Note taker per week (up for discussion)

  -- Potential/promising topics discussed:
    }} Infancy, fetal alcohol syndrome, gut microbiota and possibly include post Partum Depression stats
      >> need to find a decent metadata with enough/right parameters
    }} Parkinsons disease, Fiber diet, split cohort for analysis (ex. Male vs. Female)
      >> Could be used, but, personally I am unsure if it is "novel" enough, despite the Prof saying it would be if it distinguished the            differences between male and female
  
  -- Other relavent topics but not sure:
    }} Canabis, drugs, smoking, Vaping (Canabis Dataset unknown, novelty unsure)
    }} Depression, Long-term drug use, immune health, medication burden (unknown difficulty of finding datasets for burden)
