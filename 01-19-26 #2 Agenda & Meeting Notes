01/19/26 Agenda:
DISCUSS AND PICK A RESEARCH QUESTION (ALSO VALIDATE PAPERS/METADATASET):
- Is there a correlation between carotenoid levels and Coffee consumption in healthy and Parkinson's Disease populations
  > On Canvas PD Paper

- Alcohol Consumption topic:
  > Is there a synergistic relationship between smoking and alcohol dependence on the depletion of the gut microbiome?
  > Are there taxonomic signatures that distinguish pancreatic and head and neck cancer cases from each other within the alcohol-dependent population?
    * Both on the same Canvas Paper

- Infant faecal microbiota
> link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-024-00562-0?fromPaywallRec=false
> Do male and female infants differ in gut microbiome disruption and post-diarrhoeal recovery trajectories in early life?
--> since there is longitudinal data (1 patient over multiple time points)
> Does infant sex modify the association between hygiene-related environmental exposure and gut microbiome composition in early life?
--> small cohort though unfortunately
> Are there sex differences in the microbiome composition impacted by underweightedness in infants?

- Are older gastric cancer patients more likely to experience gut microbiome imbalance compared to younger patients?
  > On Canvas Gastric Cancer paper

CONFIRM MEETING NOTETAKER RESPONSIBILITIES:
  - Suggested cycle by the week based on First Name Alphabetical order

Send dataset/externalPaper links to Jeremy.kh.siu@gmail.com if you find any by Sunday 5pm.

01/19/26 Meeting:
- Parkinson's Disease
> caffeine intake and antibiotic use was found not to have any significant effects on the microbiome in previous studies so maybe steering away from that angle would be better
> could compare different antioxidants instead if we want to keep the carotenoids

- Alcohol Consumption
> synergistic relationship of alcohol consumption and smoking has been done before so not a novel topic
> how do different levels and types of alcohol affect the microbiome? - a potential avenue --> will need to categorize people
> could either use only controls or only cancer patients (this would be good to introduce this if the topic is not novel)
> TA found that the different types of alcohol and effects on microbiome has already been done - but they did not delve very far into it
> better for this to be a backup because taxonomic portion has already been analyzed

-Infant faecal microbiota
> using the longitudinal data is a good idea but the diarrheal episodes make it tricky, but could focus on 1 visit and then analyze the longitudinal data for one other aspect
> comparing sex with another variable would make the cohorts very limited, it would be hard to get good statistical results
> with the limited amount of time that we have, might be better to look at another dataset
> could be a backup

-Gastric Cancer
> looking at patient age (old vs young) and gastric cancer and their microbiome - it has been looked at before unfortunately

Final decision:
> parkinson's disease dataset makes the most sense to use but we would need to do some more research to figure out what our research question is exactly
> find a comparison group or do a functional analysis

Next steps:
> start pipeline
> work on new container sent in Canvas Inbox - for anything project related
> start looking at the group assignment - alocate tasks (coding, literature review, etc.)
