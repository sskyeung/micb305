  >>Part 1: 
    >> good job defining research question:
    >> Very detailed: but norfolk reccomendations, taken without our dataset in mind
    >> should stratify our samples into the Norfolkparameters and cutoffs
      >> could have uneven splits between groups due to cutoffs
      >> should aim to have equal split between those groups
        >> 2 options in sex specific cutoffs: 
            1. use males and drop Norfolk and somehow merge medians and SD
            2. don't use males and use Norfolk

    >>Literature review was good.

      >> Focus on the Last MIND literature and results
