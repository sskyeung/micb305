Agenda: 
  Questions to bring to TA:
  - Norfolk Metric separates by male and female for median and averages. Should We?
  - Should we include ALL Antioxidant variables, including those that indirectly affect function?

Meeting Notes:

FULL MARKS LETSGOOOO!!!!

- Another group doing the same things but with antioxidants and parkinsons severity
  >> we should make sure to focus on the preventive side of things

Coments and feedback:
- They will be released when the assignment is returned:
  >>Part 1: 
    >> good job defining research question:
    >> Very detailed: but norfolk reccomendations, taken without our dataset in mind
    >> should stratify our samples into the Norfolkparameters and cutoffs
      >> could have uneven splits between groups due to cutoffs
      >> should aim to have equal split between those groups
        >> 2 options in sex specific cutoffs: 
            1. use males and drop Norfolk and somehow merge medians and SD
            2. don't use males and use Norfolk

    >>Literature review was good.
      >> Look into both MIND projects literature
      >> Focus on the Last MIND literature and results
        >> could be beneficial for our discussions and antioxidants with the Mediterranean Diet

  >>PART 2:
    >> should redo Alpha-rarefaction curve to find new Sample depth with new MetaData file after making new Categories and binning for sex

  >>PART 3:
    >> Great job for all.

- Group assignment 2 is focused on the Analysis we will use and such

- Variables to use options:
  - base off literature (hypothesis driven research)
  - perform Beta diversity analysis and see which antioxidant varibale affects microbial composition the most (Discovery driven approach)
- using so many variables increasing the chance of having false positives
  - False discovery rate funciton: less tests and less variables = better

Next Steps:
- Do assignment 4 and familiarize with the Data
- Assignment 5 might be difficuult because the TA needs to be able to reproduce it
- in terms of Group work, try and see if we can start modulating the dataset and create categorical variables for our future analysis
  - brainstorm different analysis and aims
  - possibly do Stratefication first before we get to Beta Diversity week.
