01/21/2026 Agenda:
FINALIZE TOPIC:
- Fruit standalone, Milk + fats/oils, or preservatives correlating to Parkinson's Disease age onset.
- Ask Avril for suggestions on topic and decide after.
  -> His suggestion during office hour: 
     -> We stick to Parkinson's Disease age onset as there hasn't been many researches around that.
     -> For the food groups, he said groups with antioxidant is a good route, but if not novel we can use different food groups such as milk 
        and fruits. 
    -> he recommends looking up information on MIND and Mediterranean diets as these are relevant to PD onset and explicitly cover each of 
       these food groups. 
- Our next steps: 1. start running the PD dataset through the QIIME2 pipeline 2. Research into each of the foods to see if they are correlated 
  with microbiome data. -> Choose foods with the least amount of prior analysis. 

- Possible Research Question after suggestion: 
Is dietary intake of antioxidants associated with gut microbiome composition and the age of Parkinson’s disease onset?

01/26/26 Meeting:
Our set research question: 
Is dietary intake of antioxidants associated with gut microbiome composition and the age of Parkinson’s disease onset?

- We should give ourselves enough time for code as the code itself will take a while -> Start Qiime ASAP
- Step that will take the longest: training our own classifiers
  -> Under module 6 (MPT: Taxonomic analysis), there is a code for training your classifiers
- Find primers under the method section of the literature
  -> Should be a document that contains the sequence of the primers 
- For the group assignment, the Parkinson dataset isn't public, thus go over the literature review and UJEMI. 
- We don't have to filter the dataset -> exclude mitochondrial and chloroplast
   -> But if we have time, it is good to filter.

Tasks: 
Kyle: down to table.qza and reps-seqs.qza
Jeremy: Training classifier
James: continue from Kyle, rarefraction depth and rarefraction curve
Denali: Literature Review
Riko: Literature Review
