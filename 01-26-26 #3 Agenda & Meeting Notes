01/21/2026 Agenda:
FINALIZE TOPIC:
- Fruit standalone, Milk + fats/oils, or preservatives correlating to Parkinson's Disease age onset.
- Ask Avril for suggestions on topic and decide after.
  -> His suggestion: 
     -> We stick to Parkinson's Disease age onset as there hasn't been many researches around that.
     -> For the food groups, he said groups with antioxidant is a good route, but if not novel we can use different food groups such as milk 
        and fruits. 
    -> he recommends looking up information on MIND and Mediterranean diets as these are relevant to PD onset and explicitly cover each of 
       these food groups.
